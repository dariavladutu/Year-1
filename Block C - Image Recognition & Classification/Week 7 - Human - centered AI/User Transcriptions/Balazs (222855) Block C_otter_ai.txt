Yeah, are the buttons working? Yes, they are. Take a picture. Nice.

Oh, nice, yeah, here you would have, like, just the general monthly or weekly statistics about the amount of product and the sum.

0:29  
Okay, very intuitive, very self explanatory. I don't have to look for anything. It's pretty much in front of me. You can find everything easily. Getting a lot of information. The statistics is a very nice touch. It kind of covers everything that I would expect from an app

Yeah, here you have, like, a little alert system for them. This is basically the Manager page. And then here they would log in...

1:02  
Oh, a dashboard?

1:03  
Yeah, pretty much the dashboard where they would have, 

1:07  
Oh, I love the history function also

1:10  
So they can read or...

Okay, then I think I mentioned all the good stuff, but you need some bell right where you have to improve. Okay, the design is really good, but sometimes it's lacking. So for example here, this is very minimal. Really good. Colours are pretty great, but here, this colour is kind of off. You see those square thingies is you kind of have a padding everywhere, so like, really gap and you don't have it. Like, it throws me off from the design, but otherwise, it looks good.

Okay, thank you, Balazs

1:46
