# Block C - Data Modelling

This block will focus on the __*Modeling*__ phase of the __*CRISP-DM*__ lifecycle. You will learn how to conduct market/consumer research and how to build transparent, interpretable, and fair deep learning models for image classification. In addition, you will learn how to integrate these concepts for the development of user-centered applications.

## Creative Brief

The [Innovation Square](https://www.buas.nl/en/collaboration/innovation-square) is your client in this block. The Innovation Square is a dynamic hub at Breda University of Applied Sciences that integrates education, research, and industry. It's a place where collaboration and innovation connects education and practice-oriented research to activities in the relevant industries. They approached you - as an aspiring __Data Scientist__ - to apply your expertise in providing innovative data-driven solutions. In particular, they require your assistance in proposing and developing a creative and innovative application utilizing deep learning for image classification. The challenge is to identify a problem where image classification can provide significant business value and/or societal impact in any area or industry.

Therefore, the main objective of this project is to develop an image classification application using deep learning and your own image dataset. To this end, you will need to create a project proposal that touches upon the following topics:
- Market/consumer research and risk assessment;
- The design and implementation of a transparent, interpretable (and fair) deep learning-based image classifier;
- The development of a user-centered prototype application for your image classifier.

The top 3 projects with the best business value will have the unique opportunity to present their results directly to the Innovation Square and a specially invited group of entrepreneurs from [BUas Startup Support](https://www.buas.nl/en/study/entrepreneurship) (like in the TV shows [Shark Tank](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shark_Tank) and [Dragons' Den](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dragons%27_Den_(British_TV_programme))), which can provide valuable insights and even support for further development of the projects, potentially transforming your academic projects into viable and standalone business ventures. This is more than just a project; it's a potential launchpad for your entrepreneurial journey!
