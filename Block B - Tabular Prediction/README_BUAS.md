# Block B - Data Understanding and Preparation
Transitioning from Block A's foundation of Business understanding, Block B delves into practical implementation and hands-on experience.

Learning data science models through a hands-on approach is paramount for several reasons, such as:

- Foster your practical understanding by applying theory to real-world problems, ensuring comprehension beyond just theory.
- Enhance your problem-solving skills, as students encounter and overcome challenges while working with real data.
- Improve your creativity and innovation, as hands-on experience allows for experimentation and customization of models.
- Prepare yourself for the demands of the industry, where practical skills are highly valued.
