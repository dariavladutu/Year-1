## Project Overview  
In this final team-based project, we collaborated to design a predictive solution for the **ANWB (Royal Dutch Touring Club)**. The goal was to explore how historical trip data and geospatial information could be used to predict driver destinations in real time, supporting smarter mobility and infrastructure planning.

---

## Problem Statement  
The ANWB collects GPS trip data from vehicle drivers across the Netherlands. Our task: create a system that predicts the **final destination** of a trip in progress, using only data collected until a given momentâ€”enabling applications like early traffic warnings, route suggestions, or service alerts.

---

## Team Project, Individual Grading  
While the solution was developed collaboratively, each student maintained their own notebook, logs, and deliverables. This README reflects my **individual contributions**, particularly in data preprocessing, model design, and evaluation.

---

## Data Highlights  
- Raw GPS logs: ~57,000 trajectories  
- Attributes: Latitude, longitude, timestamp, anonymized driver ID  
- Processed features: distance, speed, stop detection, bearing, trip ID, normalized path encoding

---

## Preprocessing & Feature Engineering  
- Outlier removal using z-scores on distance and time deltas  
- Stop detection via velocity thresholds  
- Polyline simplification (Douglas-Peucker)  
- Feature engineering:
  - Cumulative trip distance
  - Segment speed and heading direction
  - Time since trip start
  - Latitude/longitude normalization

---

## Model Design  
### Final Model: **XGBoost Classifier**
- Predicts final grid cell based on partial trajectory
- Trained on split trajectory windows (~30%â€“70%)
- Tuned with GridSearchCV

### Benchmarked with:
- k-Nearest Neighbors
- Random Forest
- Support Vector Machines
- Naive Baseline (last known point)

---

## Evaluation
- Accuracy: **83.6%** (XGBoost)
- Visual validation on Folium maps and grid overlays
- Error radius used as a second metric for real-world viability

---

## Responsible AI & Ethics  
- Ensured GPS anonymization throughout the pipeline  
- Complied with GDPR principles on geospatial tracking  
- Considered bias from trip frequency and geographic imbalance  

---

## Tools & Technologies
- `Python`, `scikit-learn`, `XGBoost`, `Pandas`, `NumPy`  
- `Folium`, `Geopandas`, `Matplotlib`  
- Trello (team management)  
- Jupyter Notebook (final delivery)
