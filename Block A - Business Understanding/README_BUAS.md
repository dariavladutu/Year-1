# Block A - Business Understanding

Block A focuses on the first stage of the *__CRISP-DM__* process, known as *__Business Understanding__*. This phase entails acquiring a deep understanding of the business context and requirements.

During this phase, you will acquire the skills necessary to formulate a research question that can be addressed through data analysis. You will learn how to find, and collect appropriate data from relevant sources, explore and analyze the collected data, and visualize your findings effectively using the programming language Python and the dashboarding tool Power BI. By doing so, you will be able to propose a solution to your research question, substantiated by sound arguments derived from your analysis. Finally, you will gain proficiency in presenting your findings to the client in a clear and concise manner.

## Creative Brief

The Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) were established by the United Nations in 2015 to guide countries in achieving a sustainable future. These 17 global objectives encompass a wide range of areas, including poverty eradication, education, gender equality, economic growth, climate action, and environmental protection.

The *__SDG Hub@BUas__*, referred to as the client, has reached out to you as an aspiring - *__data professional__* - to apply your expertise in providing data-driven solutions. In particular, they require your assistance in monitoring and assessing the advancements made towards the SDGs on a global and/or country-specific scale. 


The objective is to *__develop an interactive dashboard utilizing your newly acquired skills in data analytics and visualization__*. The dashboard will provide valuable insights to policymakers, researchers, and activists, enabling them to make informed decisions and take targeted actions towards the SDGs. Moreover, it will serve as a tool to raise awareness among the general public, inspiring collective efforts towards creating a more sustainable and equitable world.

Good luck!
