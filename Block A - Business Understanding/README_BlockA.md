## Project Overview  
This dashboard project applied the **Business Understanding** and early **Data Understanding** phases of the CRISP-DM methodology to the **Sustainable Development Goals (SDG 11)**. Using publicly available European data, I created an interactive dashboard to help stakeholders identify trends, challenges, and progress toward sustainable urban development.

## Objectives  
- Translate a global policy goal (SDG 11) into data-driven questions  
- Source, clean, and integrate SDG data  
- Present actionable insights for policymakers through Power BI  
- Communicate results in a stakeholder-focused presentation

## Dashboard Overview  

### Research Questions  
1. How do European countries manage the waste they produce?  
2. How do house prices and income correlate from 2019 to 2021?  
3. Which countries are pioneers in smart immersive city technologies?  
4. What is the largest air pollutant emitted in the EU?  
5. What are the top 5 countries by GDP share invested in inland transport?  
6. How will the homeless population trend over the next 10 years?

### Dashboard Pages  
- **Waste Management**: Recycling vs. landfilling, CO₂ emissions  
- **Housing & Homelessness**: Affordability ratios and trend forecasting  
- **Transport & Pollution**: Investment analysis and pollutant shares  
- **Tech & Innovation**: Smart city leadership and environmental spending  

### Key Insights  
- Sweden and Denmark are SDG 11 leaders  
- High housing costs correlate with increased homelessness  
- CO makes up ~46% of EU air pollution  
- Not all high transport investment leads to sustainability  
- Urban tech adoption links to broader SDG success
